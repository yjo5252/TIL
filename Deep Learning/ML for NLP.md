* Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing and text analytics 
  *  the role of ML is to improve, accelerate and automate the underlying [text analytics functions and NLP features] that turn this unstructured text into useable data and insights. 
  *  text documents : social media comments, online reviews, survey responses, financial, medical, legal and regulatory documents.

  * maintain supervised and unsupervised machine learing models that augment and imporve our systems. 
  * gather datasets and experiment with new algorithms

## overview 
  * machine learning for natural language processing approaches. 
  * how to apply machine learning to solve probelms in natural language processing and text analytics.

## Background: what is Natural language Processing? 
* the study and development of computer systems that can interpret speech and text as humans natrually speak and type it. 
* the difficulty for computer analysis of natural language : colloquialisms(비속어), abbreviations(약어), misspellings(오타)
* text contains three aspects
  * semantic information 
  * syntax information 
  * context information 

### semantic information 
* individual word's specific meaning.
* know the relevant definition of a word. 

### syntax information 
* sentence or phrase structure.
* ex: Sarah joined the group already with some search experience. 


### context information  
* context appears in word, phrase, sentence.
* sick - healthcare or games. 

## ML vs NLP and using machine learning on natural language processing. 
* (1) machine learning models are great at recognizing entities and overall sentiment for a document, 
  * but struggle to extract themes and topics, and they are not very good at matching sentiment to individual entities or themes. 
* (2) teach your system to identify the basic rules and patterns of language
  * but, recording and implementing language rules takes a lot of time 
* (3) hybrid apporach: train a range of supervised and unsupervised models. 
## Hybrid Machine Leraning systems for NLP 
* when adding a new language 
1. code in the patterns and rules that the language follows. 
2. supervised and unsupervised machine learning models keep these rules in mind when developing their classifiers
3. apply variations on this system for low-, mid-, and high-level text functions 
  * <b>low-level text functions </b>
    * the initial processes through which you run any text input.
    * turn unstructure text into structured data. 
  * <b>mid-level text functions </b>
    * the process through which you extract the the real content of a document of text.
    * who is speaking. who is speaking 
    * what they are say8ing, what they are talking about.
