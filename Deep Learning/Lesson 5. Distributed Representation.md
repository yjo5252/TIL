## Distributed Representations
### Natural Lanugage preprocessing 

* Distributed Representations : 확장 축소 가능하고 상호의존적인 계층에서 같은 특징을 설명하는 것 

5.1. Introduction 
* word embeddings : a core representation of text in deep learning approaches 
* distributional hypothesis : explain how it can be leveraged to form semantic representations of words
    * common distributional semantic models : word2vec, GloVe, and etc. 
* shortcoming of embedding models 
* shortcoming of extensino to document and concept representation 
* several applications to natural language processing tasks 
* a case study focused on language modeling
