## RTOS (Real-Time Operating Sysetms) 

### 실시간 운영체제가 필요한 이유 
1. Resource Management 
  * Task Scheduling 
    * To handle multiple tasks with different invocation rates or prioirties
  * I/O Handling
    * To handle multiple interrupts from internal and/or external events
2. Services & Managements 
  * Resource sharing or task syncrhonization (or task ordersing dependency, e.g. A must precede B) 
  * Timing services
  * Dynamic memory management

### RTOS을 사용하는 시스템 구조 
1. RTOS (a set of functions which are called from application code) / Kernel (a core set of essential services) 
2. Application code / ISRs
3. System Hardware 


### RTOS application code: example 
```c
void main(void)
{
  /* initialize (but don't start) the RTOS */
  InitRTOS();
  
  /* Tell the RTOS about our tasks */
  StartTask(RespondToButton, HIGH_PRIORITY);
  StartTask(CalculateTakeLevels, LOW_PRIORITY);

  /* Actually start the RTOS (This functino never returns)*/
  StartRTOS();
}

```

### RTOS essentials: tasks 
* each task run independently 
* each task has its own __private context__ 
  * register values 
  * program counter
  * stack 
* All other data is shared by all tasks. 
* Tasks are more like threads.
